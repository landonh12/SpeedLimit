# SpeedLimit
Just a small little app I made to help me and my girlfriend communicate what speed we want to go while on a long drive.

## Features
- Keeps track of the last speed you sent
- Pulls up a modal MessageUI to allow us to quickly send a message - no texting and driving!

## Future
- I'd maybe like to update the UI, use Push Notifications instead of iMessages, set up a server, etc...
